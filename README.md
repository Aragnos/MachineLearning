Machine Learning Algorithms - Implemented in ABAP

Please use a new folder for each algorithm. Within a folder, several implementations of the same algorithm can be grouped together.
For Code used between several algorithms, e.g. helper classes etc., use the Util folder. Reference the Util folder in the comments of your implementation.

Fire away.
